## Weather App by Leandro Perez

## Description

The weather app is a web application that enables users to search for the weather in different cities. Users can enter the name of a city in a search field and retrieve detailed information about the current weather in that city.

The app utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data for the specified city. The data includes the current temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

In addition to the current weather information, the app displays a detailed weather forecast for the current day, including temperature and weather description at hourly intervals. It also shows a weather forecast for the next 5 days, including the maximum and minimum temperatures and an overview of the weather for each day.

The app offers the option to use the browser's Geolocation API to automatically retrieve the user's location and display the current weather for their location. This allows users to quickly view the weather in their area without manually searching for a city.

The app's interface is intuitively designed and user-friendly. Users can quickly navigate between the current weather information and the forecasts for upcoming days. Additionally, the app displays weather icons corresponding to the weather description to enhance the visual experience.

In summary, this weather app provides users with the ability to search for and obtain detailed weather information for different cities, as well as view their own current weather using geolocation. It's a useful tool for staying informed about weather conditions and planning activities accordingly.
